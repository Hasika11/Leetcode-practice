Question1-reverse digits of an integer.  for program  'reverse.py'

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Example1:
Input: 123
Output:  321

Example2:
Input: -123
Output: -321

Example3:
Input: 120
Output: 21

Question2- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, for program- 'Longest_substring.py'
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
